# Autoencoder
An implementation of auto encoder on MNIST Dataset so as to generate similar images using neural networks.

The model uses an encoder and a decoder sequential model which are then combined using another sequential model. Sigmoid activation is used on the encoder and decoder models. The MNIST images are then fed to this model and then an image from the dataset is fed to the trained model so as to generate a predicted image.

# Result
